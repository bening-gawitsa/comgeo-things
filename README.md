# Computational Geophysics Notes

Welcome to the repository for **Computational Geophysics**. This project contains documented implementations of algorithms and numerical experiments relevant to geophysical modeling and inversion. The code is written in **Python**, using **Jupyter Notebooks** for clarity and reproducibility.

## 📌 Overview

This repository serves as both a personal study log and a reference collection of algorithms used in various areas of **computational geophysics**, such as:

- 1D Heat Conduction

Each notebook provides detailed explanations, derivations, and implementations designed for transparency and learning.
